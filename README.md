Each directory is a part from the assignment, with each one containing its own README file for documentation.

# Part 1 answer:
The given code will print the following line five times (equal to the array's size):
"The element in position 5 is: undefined"

This happens because of the initialization of i using var. When setTimeout is called in each iteration, it doesnâ€™t capture the current value of i at that moment. Instead, it captures a reference to the i variable itself. Since var is function-scoped rather than block-scoped, all iterations in the loop share the same i variable in memory.

As a result, when the loop completes (in under 5 seconds), i has already reached the value of 5. When setTimeout callbacks execute after the delay, they all see i as 5, leading to the output "The element in position 5 is: undefined" because the array has no element at index 5.

If we replace var with let, we would get the expected behavior. Using let creates a new instance of i for each iteration due to its block-scoping. Consequently, each setTimeout callback captures its own unique i value specific to that iteration, allowing it to access the correct element in the array.
